Abstraction 
-a term which means building more complex things on less complex things

a string is an array where each element has a char value and a pointer to the next item


----------------
class	        |
----------------
char* 		|	
char*	1st 	|
	2nd	|
	3rd	|
----------------




----------------------------
stack | Queue | Hash Table |         //stack and queue are simple vectors
----------------------------
Vector                     |	    //Vector is an array that can expand indefinetly 
----------------------------
	      Array        |         
----------------------------        // bottom to top 
Pointer  | Class           |        // levels of abstraction 
----------------------------



to find something on the heap you need a reference 
stacks have value 

//try creating a stack and queue using only pointers




Map Lab 
 
West/East 
new.x = old.x +- 1
new.y = old.y

North/South
new.x= old.x 
new.y = old.y +- 1





Hash Table //?
key|Value
----------		// hash is a way of representing what we want to store
0,0|home
----------
0,1|S1
----------      each entry should only be in here once
1,-1|SE1
----------
1,0|E1
----------

hash Algorithm 

"x" + ","  + "y"
 
"1,0"  x=1

map lab 
a map needs a hash table 
#include <unordered_map> // term map means mapping keys to values
