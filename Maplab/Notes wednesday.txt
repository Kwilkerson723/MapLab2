-push/pop front/back

Stack
-peek 
-push/popback
has to go in order
can only push/pop from the back 
FILO first in last out

Queue
-peek push back pop front
its a line front to back
front pops back pushes 
FIFO First in First out

//all of these structures derive from arrays

always initalize pointers or the compiler will pick a random space in memory

project 2
mapLab
if you havent been somewhere you can name the place
we want to go indefinatly in any direction 
we want the program to remember the places you've named

//get bank lab and map lab and resolve the to do statements
implement GetPathBackToHome()
how?
follow path created back?
log path and show path?
show all map locations? // could be ineffective once it gets to large
give directions one space at a time?

//USE a stack, push on the stack where ever you've been 
//makes sense to use a stack becasue the first place you see is home
//pop.back until you reach home
//print all locations you have been backwards until you get home
Next thing-------------------------
HowDidIGetHere
//use Queue push back and pop front.

teleport home? //no but could be interesting


implement south,east,west
